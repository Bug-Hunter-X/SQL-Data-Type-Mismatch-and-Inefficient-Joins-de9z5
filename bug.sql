In SQL, a common error is using the wrong data type for a column. For example, attempting to store text in a numeric column, or vice versa.  This can lead to data truncation, unexpected results, and even database crashes.  Another subtle issue is improper use of joins, especially with large datasets.  Inefficient joins can lead to extremely slow query execution times or even out-of-memory errors.
