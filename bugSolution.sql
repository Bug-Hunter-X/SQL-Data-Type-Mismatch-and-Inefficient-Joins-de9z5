To correct the data type mismatch, ensure that the column's data type appropriately represents the type of data being stored. If text needs to be stored, use VARCHAR, TEXT or other suitable text types; if numbers are required, use INT, FLOAT, DECIMAL as appropriate.  Regarding inefficient joins, consider using indexes on the join columns to speed up lookups.  Also, be very careful with using `JOIN` without a `WHERE` clause. Using `INNER JOIN` or `LEFT JOIN` based on the specific requirements helps to prevent generating a huge dataset.  Also consider using smaller select statements instead of selecting all columns using `SELECT *`.
