This repository contains examples of two common SQL errors: data type mismatch and inefficient joins.  The `bug.sql` file demonstrates code that leads to these issues, while `bugSolution.sql` shows how to fix them.  The first example highlights incorrect data type usage which results in data truncation or insertion errors.  The second shows the performance penalty of using inefficient JOINs, such as a Cartesian product, on large datasets, along with best practice solutions such as using indexed columns and more selective WHERE clauses.
